EOS meetup demo - Scatter extension

I demo’d a simple dApp at our [EOS meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/EOS-Dapp-Development-Meetup/). Here’s what we do:
* If no Scatter / EOS connection… we show nothing
* If we do find that we have Scatter… we will have the extension prompt for access to an identity.
* If we “Approve” access to that identity, we unlock all the EOS goodies.
* If we “Decline” then we handle that scenario and let the person know they were “oh so close”.
